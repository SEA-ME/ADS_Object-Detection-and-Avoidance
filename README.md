## Description

This project is designed to give you a hands-on experience in developing an object detection and avoidance system for vehicles, using both virtual simulations and real-world hardware implementation. Utilizing platforms like CARLA, Gazebo, or AirSim, you will create a system that not only detects obstacles in a vehicle's path but also performs autonomous maneuvers to avoid potential collisions while ensuring passenger safety.

</br>

## Forewords

The history of object detection and avoidance in automotive technology is a testament to the advances in computer vision and sensor integration. What began as a rudimentary alert system has now evolved into sophisticated autonomous interventions. This project channels the essence of these innovations, offering a glimpse into the future of vehicular autonomy where safety and technology go hand in hand.

## Objective / Goal of the project

- To develop a robust simulation-based object detection and avoidance system that can detect obstacles and execute safe lane changes.
- To generate alerts for drivers during autonomous maneuvers and ensure smooth reintegration into traffic.
- To successfully implement and test the system on a PiRacer model car, using real cameras and sensors.

</br>

## Mandatory Part

1. Create a simulation environment with a vehicle, test track, and a suite of simulated sensors.
2. Program the vehicle to detect objects using camera and sensor data and to determine safe avoidance strategies.
3. Implement visual and auditory warning systems for alerting during autonomous interventions.
4. Design and apply algorithms for steering and braking to facilitate safe object avoidance and lane changes.
5. Transfer the simulation model to a PiRacer, incorporating real hardware sensors and testing in a controlled environment.

</br>

## Common Instruction

- Follow software development best practices, including version control and modular coding.
- Test each subsystem individually before full-system integration.
- Ensure all team members are familiar with both the simulation environment and the real-world hardware.
- In simulation, prioritize the integrity of the virtual environment to prevent system crashes.
- During real-world testing, use a controlled environment free from external interference.
- Always monitor the PiRacer during testing to manually override in case of malfunctions.

</br>

## Skills

- Proficiency in the use of simulation software for autonomous systems.
- Advanced knowledge of computer vision techniques and sensor data fusion.
- Practical experience in embedded systems programming and hardware integration.
- Critical problem-solving skills in dynamic and unpredictable scenarios.
